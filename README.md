# BellyButton_Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to create an interactive dashboard that would allow Roza's research participants to see the bacterial data for each of their belly buttons. Now the volunteers can easily see the top 10 species of bacteria that populate their belly buttons. They will need to see this dashboard for when the scientists at Improbable Beef uncover which species they will be using to make their artificial beef products so they can see if their belly button contains that strain!
